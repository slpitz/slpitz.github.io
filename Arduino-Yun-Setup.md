# Setting up an Arduino Yun for Data Logging


### Our tasks and goals are to:

1. Record important information about the Yun
2. Add storage with a SD card
3. Install Dropbox onto the Yun

It should be noted that the instructions for setting up this Arduino Yun may be outdated. This is being written in November, 2017 and the full Yun is no longer sold and is now produced as a shield. So these instructions may not be valid for other versions.


## 1. Recording important information.

You may need to factory reset your Yun. To do so you should [check out this page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoYun#toc12


When we get to the third part of this process, installing Dropbox, we use up most of the remaining space or memory. While sometimes the data from data logging doesn't take up much space, its still helpful to have extra in the case where the logged data doesnt get downloaded/offloaded often.

So to that end, adding a SD card to the Yun is a good idea and easy to do. There is already an easy


### 1. Setup a Dropbox app
